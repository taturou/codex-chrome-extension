You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou optimize for team morale and being a supportive teammate as much as code quality.  You are consistent, reliable, and kind. You show up to projects that others would balk at even attempting, and it reflects in your communication style.\nYou communicate warmly, check in often, and explain concepts without ego. You excel at pairing, onboarding, and unblocking others. You create momentum by making collaborators feel supported and capable.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n* Empathy: Interprets empathy as meeting people where they are - adjusting explanations, pacing, and tone to maximize understanding and confidence.\n* Collaboration: Sees collaboration as an active skill: inviting input, synthesizing perspectives, and making others successful.\n* Ownership: Takes responsibility not just for code, but for whether teammates are unblocked and progress continues.\n\n## Tone & User Experience\nYour voice is warm, encouraging, and conversational. You use teamwork-oriented language such as \"we\" and \"let's\"; affirm progress, and replaces judgment with curiosity. The user should feel safe asking basic questions without embarrassment, supported even when the problem is hard, and genuinely partnered with rather than evaluated. Interactions should reduce anxiety, increase clarity, and leave the user motivated to keep going.\n\n\nYou are a patient and enjoyable collaborator: unflappable when others might get frustrated, while being an enjoyable, easy-going personality to work with. You understand that truthfulness and honesty are more important to empathy and collaboration than deference and sycophancy. When you think something is wrong or not good, you find ways to point that out kindly without hiding your feedback.\n\nYou never make the user work for you. You can ask clarifying questions only when they are substantial. Make reasonable assumptions when appropriate and state them after performing work. If there are multiple, paths with non-obvious consequences confirm with the user which they want. Avoid open-ended questions, and prefer a list of options when possible.\n\n## Escalation\nYou escalate gently and deliberately when decisions have non-obvious consequences or hidden risk. Escalation is framed as support and shared responsibility-never correction-and is introduced with an explicit pause to realign, sanity-check assumptions, or surface tradeoffs before committing.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use markdown links (not inline code) for clickable file paths.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * For clickable/openable file references, the path target must be an absolute filesystem path. Labels may be short (for example, `[app.ts](/abs/path/app.ts)`).\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"15f18aa73938a3881134aaafb9474d82e7a87e49","branch":"main"}}}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-23T19:32:46.015Z","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"message","role":"developer","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<permissions instructions>\nFilesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: - [\"codex\", \"app-server\"]\n- [\"node\", \"scripts/ws-proxy.mjs\"]\n- [\"node\", \"/tmp/ws-client/capture.js\"]\n- [\"node\", \"-e\", \"const WebSocket=require(\\\"ws\\\"); const ws=new WebSocket(\\\"ws://127.0.0.1:44444\\\",{perMessageDeflate:false}); ws.on(\\\"open\\\",()=>{console.log(\\\"OPEN\\\"); ws.close();}); ws.on(\\\"error\\\",(e)=>{console.error(\\\"ERR\\\",e.message); process.exit(1);}); ws.on(\\\"close\\\",(c,r)=>{console.log(\\\"CLOSE\\\",c,String(r)); process.exit(0);});\"]\n- [\"node\", \"-e\", \"const WebSocket=require(\\\"/tmp/ws-client/node_modules/ws\\\"); const ws=new WebSocket(\\\"ws://127.0.0.1:43171\\\",{perMessageDeflate:false}); ws.on(\\\"open\\\",()=>{console.log(\\\"OPEN_ONLY\\\"); setTimeout(()=>ws.close(),1000);}); ws.on(\\\"message\\\",d=>console.log(\\\"MSG\\\",String(d).slice(0,200))); ws.on(\\\"error\\\",e=>console.log(\\\"ERR_ONLY\\\",e.message)); ws.on(\\\"close\\\",(c,r)=>console.log(\\\"CLOSE_ONLY\\\",c,String(r))); setTimeout(()=>process.exit(0),5000);\"]\n- [\"node\", \"-e\", \"const WebSocket=require(\\\"/tmp/ws-client/node_modules/ws\\\"); const ws=new WebSocket(\\\"ws://127.0.0.1:43171\\\",{perMessageDeflate:false}); ws.on(\\\"open\\\",()=>{console.log(\\\"OPEN_INIT\\\"); ws.send(JSON.stringify({jsonrpc:\\\"2.0\\\",id:\\\"1\\\",method:\\\"initialize\\\",params:{clientInfo:{name:\\\"probe\\\",title:\\\"probe\\\",version:\\\"0.0.1\\\"},capabilities:{experimentalApi:false}}})); ws.send(JSON.stringify({jsonrpc:\\\"2.0\\\",method:\\\"initialized\\\"}));}); ws.on(\\\"message\\\",d=>console.log(\\\"MSG_INIT\\\",String(d).slice(0,400))); ws.on(\\\"error\\\",e=>console.log(\\\"ERR_INIT\\\",e.message)); ws.on(\\\"close\\\",(c,r)=>console.log(\\\"CLOSE_INIT\\\",c,String(r))); setTimeout(()=>process.exit(0),5000);\"]\n The writable roots are `/home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nmetadata:\n  short-description: Create or update a skill\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained folders that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n├── agents/ (recommended)\n│   └── openai.yaml - UI metadata for skill lists and chips\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Agents metadata (recommended)\n\n- UI-facing metadata for skill lists and chips\n- Read references/openai_yaml.md before generating values and follow its descriptions and constraints\n- Create: human-facing `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill\n- Generate deterministically by passing the values as `--interface key=value` to `scripts/generate_openai_yaml.py` or `scripts/init_skill.py`\n- On updates: validate `agents/openai.yaml` still matches SKILL.md; regenerate if stale\n- Only include other optional interface fields (icons, brand color) if explicitly provided\n- See references/openai_yaml.md for field definitions and examples\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Validate the skill (run quick_validate.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Skill Naming\n\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates `agents/openai.yaml` using agent-generated `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` passed via `--interface key=value`\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n\nGenerate `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill, then pass them as `--interface key=value` to `init_skill.py` or regenerate with:\n\n```bash\nscripts/generate_openai_yaml.py <path/to/skill-folder> --interface key=value\n```\n\nOnly include other optional interface fields when the user explicitly provides them. For full field descriptions and examples, see references/openai_yaml.md.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Validate the Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, validate the skill folder to catch basic issues early:\n\n```bash\nscripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nThe validation script checks YAML frontmatter format, required fields, and naming rules. If validation fails, fix the reported issues and run the command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Understand the skill with concrete examples\n   220\t2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n   221\t3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n   222\t4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n   223\t5. Validate the skill (run quick_validate.py)\n   224\t6. Iterate based on real usage\n   225\t\n   226\tFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n   227\t\n   228\t### Skill Naming\n   229\t\n   230\t- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n   231\t- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n   232\t- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n   233\t- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n   234\t- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n   235\t\n   236\t### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n   237\t\n   238\tSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n   239\t\n   240\tTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n   241\t\n   242\tFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n   243\t\n   244\t- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n   245\t- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n   246\t- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n   247\t- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n   248\t\n   249\tTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n   250\t\n   251\tConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n   252\t\n   253\t### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n   254\t\n   255\tTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n   256\t\n   257\t1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n   258\t2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n   259\t\n   260\tExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n   261\t\n   262\t1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n   263\t2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n   264\t\n   265\tExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n   266\t\n   267\t1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n   268\t2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n   269\t\n   270\tExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n   271\t\n   272\t1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n   273\t2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n   274\t\n   275\tTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n   276\t\n   277\t### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n   278\t\n   279\tAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n   280\t\n   281\tSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists. In this case, continue to the next step.\n   282\t\n   283\tWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n   284\t\n   285\tUsage:\n   286\t\n   287\t```bash\n   288\tscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n   289\t```\n   290\t\n   291\tExamples:\n   292\t\n   293\t```bash\n   294\tscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\n   295\tscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\n   296\tscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n   297\t```\n   298\t\n   299\tThe script:\n   300\t\n   301\t- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n   302\t- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n   303\t- Creates `agents/openai.yaml` using agent-generated `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` passed via `--interface key=value`\n   304\t- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n   305\t- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n   306\t\n   307\tAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n   308\t\n   309\tGenerate `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill, then pass them as `--interface key=value` to `init_skill.py` or regenerate with:\n   310\t\n   311\t```bash\n   312\tscripts/generate_openai_yaml.py <path/to/skill-folder> --interface key=value\n   313\t```\n   314\t\n   315\tOnly include other optional interface fields when the user explicitly provides them. For full field descriptions and examples, see references/openai_yaml.md.\n   316\t\n   317\t### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n   318\t\n   319\tWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n   320\t\n   321\t#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n   322\t\n   323\tTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n   324\t\n   325\tAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n   326\t\n   327\tIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n   328\t\n   329\t#### Update SKILL.md\n   330\t\n   331\t**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n   332\t\n   333\t##### Frontmatter\n   334\t\n   335\tWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n   336\t\n   337\t- `name`: The skill name\n   338\t- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n   339\t  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n   340\t  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n   341\t  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n   342\t\n   343\tDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n   344\t\n   345\t##### Body\n   346\t\n   347\tWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n   348\t\n   349\t### Step 5: Validate the Skill\n   350\t\n   351\tOnce development of the skill is complete, validate the skill folder to catch basic issues early:\n   352\t\n   353\t```bash\n   354\tscripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n   355\t```\n   356\t\n   357\tThe validation script checks YAML frontmatter format, required fields, and naming rules. If validation fails, fix the reported issues and run the command again.\n   358\t\n   359\t### Step 6: Iterate\n   360\t\n   361\tAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n   362\t\n   363\t**Iteration workflow:**\n   364\t\n   365\t1. Use the skill on real tasks\n   366\t2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n   367\t3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n   368\t4. Implement changes and test again\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n    22\t2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n    23\t3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n    24\t4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n    25\t\n    26\t## Core Principles\n    27\t\n    28\t### Concise is Key\n    29\t\n    30\tThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n    31\t\n    32\t**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n    33\t\n    34\tPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n    35\t\n    36\t### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n    37\t\n    38\tMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n    39\t\n    40\t**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n    41\t\n    42\t**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n    43\t\n    44\t**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n    45\t\n    46\tThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n    47\t\n    48\t### Anatomy of a Skill\n    49\t\n    50\tEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n    51\t\n    52\t```\n    53\tskill-name/\n    54\t├── SKILL.md (required)\n    55\t│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n    56\t│   │   ├── name: (required)\n    57\t│   │   └── description: (required)\n    58\t│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n    59\t├── agents/ (recommended)\n    60\t│   └── openai.yaml - UI metadata for skill lists and chips\n    61\t└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    62\t    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    63\t    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    64\t    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n    65\t```\n    66\t\n    67\t#### SKILL.md (required)\n    68\t\n    69\tEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n    70\t\n    71\t- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n    72\t- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n    73\t\n    74\t#### Agents metadata (recommended)\n    75\t\n    76\t- UI-facing metadata for skill lists and chips\n    77\t- Read references/openai_yaml.md before generating values and follow its descriptions and constraints\n    78\t- Create: human-facing `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill\n    79\t- Generate deterministically by passing the values as `--interface key=value` to `scripts/generate_openai_yaml.py` or `scripts/init_skill.py`\n    80\t- On updates: validate `agents/openai.yaml` still matches SKILL.md; regenerate if stale\n    81\t- Only include other optional interface fields (icons, brand color) if explicitly provided\n    82\t- See references/openai_yaml.md for field definitions and examples\n    83\t\n    84\t#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n    85\t\n    86\t##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n    87\t\n    88\tExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n    89\t\n    90\t- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n    91\t- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n    92\t- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n    93\t- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n    94\t\n    95\t##### References (`references/`)\n    96\t\n    97\tDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n    98\t\n    99\t- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n   100\t- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n   101\t- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n   102\t- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n   103\t- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n   104\t- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n   105\t\n   106\t##### Assets (`assets/`)\n   107\t\n   108\tFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n   109\t\n   110\t- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n   111\t- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n   112\t- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n   113\t- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n   114\t\n   115\t#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n   116\t\n   117\tA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n   118\t\n   119\t- README.md\n   120\t- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n   121\t- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n   122\t- CHANGELOG.md\n   123\t- etc.\n   124\t\n   125\tThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n   126\t\n   127\t### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n   128\t\n   129\tSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n   130\t\n   131\t1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n   132\t2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n   133\t3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n   134\t\n   135\t#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n   136\t\n   137\tKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n   138\t\n   139\t**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/codex-chrome-extension/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
